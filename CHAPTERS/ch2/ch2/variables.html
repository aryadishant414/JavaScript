  <!-- ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS 
       when we write arithmetic operators with equal sign(=) then it is called as assignment operators

       ex:   *= , /= , -= , += , ++= , etc.
  -->

  <script>

// case (1) 
    // var a = 55;
    // var b = 6;
    // a = a-b;
    // document.write("the subtraction of a and b is :" +a);

    // case(2)

    var a = 55;
    var b = 6;
    a -= b;
    document.write("the subtraction of a and b is : " +a);

    //  case 1 and case 2 both are the same.
    // so case 2 was the use of assignment operators
