// declaring constant
const pi = 3.14;
console.log(pi);
// pi = 3.15;   --> this is not possible as we cant change the value of constant as the name itself is constant which means the value of that constant will remain unchange
console.log(pi*2);


// to find power of anynumber  --> use double stars/double multiply signs i.e = **
//for ex :

let num = 2;
console.log("your number is " , num);
console.log("power of your number is : " , num**4);
